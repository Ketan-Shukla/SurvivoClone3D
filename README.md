# SurvivoClone3D
 we want to create a 3D shape-based survival game similar to Survivo io

 Gameplay Mechanics
1. Player Character
- The player character can move forward, backward, left, and right using
Virtual joystick controls.
- The player character will have a health bar that will decrease when attacked
by enemies.
- The player character will have a fixed radius around them (x units), which will
serve as a defensive zone.
- When enemies enter the player's radius, the player character will shoot
bullets, causing the enemies to decrease in health and be defeated.
- The player character can collect coins dropped by defeated enemies.
2. Enemies:
- Enemies will spawn at random positions in the game world.
- There will be two types of enemies:
a. Type 1: These enemies will move towards the player character
aggressively.
b. Type 2: These enemies will spawn at random positions and will not
move and they will attack enemies by throwing bullets or something
from a distance.

- Both enemy types will have health bars that decrease when hit by the player
character’s bullet.
- When an enemy's health bar reaches zero, they will drop coins and the
enemies will disappear from the gameplay screen.
3. Coins:
- Coins will be dropped by defeated enemies.

- The player character can collect coins to earn points or currency for in-game
upgrades.

Gameplay Flow:
1. The game starts with the player character in the center of the screen.
2. Enemies will start spawning at random positions and move towards the
player character or project attacks.
3. If an enemy enters the player character's radius, they will be defeated with
bullets projected by the player character.
4. The player character can attack enemies by shooting projectiles.
5. Enemies will take damage when hit by the player's attacks.
6. When an enemy's health bar reaches zero, they will drop coins, which the
player can collect.
7. The player character's health bar will decrease when hit by enemy attacks.
8. The game continues until the player character's health bar is empty.
9. The player'ss performance is measured based on the number of enemies
defeated and the number of coins collected.

(TODO:)

1. Jump on enemies when they are very close to the enemy for an instant
kill.
2. Enemy drop Health packs for the player character.
3. Scene Setup with lights.
